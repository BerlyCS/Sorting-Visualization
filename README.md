# Sorting Visualization

> **UPDATE:** System and general code refactored, now program support more complex algorithms and show more steps and colors!

A program that uses a command line interface to show various sorting algorithms, it uses text and sound to enhance the experience of seeing thing being sorted step-by-step.

Features 7 colors:

- **White**: Is a value that is not accessed nor swapped during the step.
- **Blue and cyan**: Access to a value in a array, generally for comparison.
- **Red and green**: Values that were swapped.
- **Yellow**: Values that are ignored during comparison.
- **Magenta**: Value that was copied to that position.

## Execution
